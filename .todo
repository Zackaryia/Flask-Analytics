What is needed to be done:
	☐ Add comments
	☐ Respect DNT (Do Not Track) headers (no session ids no visitor ids)
	☐ Make allow cookies banners to get user consent to track them
	☐ Convert the indivsual entrys into dimintions (sessions per country percent mobile devices what operating system people use what urls people visit what time of hour+day people are visiting etc)
	☐ Convert the whole analytics into a importable module
	☐ Make a Javascript tracker as well (a tracker in javascript that tracks how long your on a page if you click things)
	☐ Store anonamized data and not raw data with identifyers

Far down the road:
	☐ Support SQL as well as MongoDB and other things like DynamoDB and other databases
